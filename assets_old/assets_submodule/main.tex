\begin{abstract}
This Project uses reinforcement learning (RL) to develop flocking behaviour in drones to organise groups of UAVs using biologically inspired behavioural models. This explores how a multi-agent model is simulated and how the loss function can be constructed to achieve emergent behaviour focusing on how the reward function can be scaled with N agents. The model used is an actor-critic model as this allows for continuous action and observation states. The 2D environment is constructed by layering potential field functions and boid flocking behaviour. The agent controls drones using gains that amplify certain behaviours and is trained to maximise long term cumulative reward. The reward function is constructed using variations on the exponential function to flock and arrive within a certain number of steps. 
As a result, flocking behaviour was achieved and can be scaled although computational resources meant that this was limited. Issues in the behaviour do arise however where some drones fail to arrive at the destination, prioritising flocking. This is most likely due to reward function design as well as some limitations in the simulation. This dissertation demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be used with multi-vehicle UAV applications. By changing the (RL) structure to a more suitable multi-agent particle environment such as the ones available in the openAI database this could be applied at different scales whilst being much more conservative with computational requirements.

\begin{acknowledgement}
I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Dr Kevin Worrall for providing me with advice and steering me towards information that would prove essential to this dissertation. Dr Worrall has also advised me further and is one of the reasons I have chosen to pursue a MSc of robotics and artificial intelligence at the university of Glasgow.\\
Dr Dezong Zhao's, my professor for autonomous guided systems has also been an enormous help in creating the model that was used in this dissertation. I would like to thank him for his clear and well-formulated lectures from which I have derived a lot of the code for the simulation.\\
I would also like to thank Daniel Shiffman, the author of the nature of code, who's  tutorials have been an enormous help in learning how to code multiple agents efficiently.\cite{cod2}\\
In addition, I would like to thank Dr Lex Fridman, a professor of the university of MIT, who has provided his lectures on deep neural networks for free. \cite{lex1}\\
